# Git & GitHub Session Review Website 🚀

This project was created as part of a Git & GitHub learning session.

The objective was to simulate a real-world collaborative workflow using GitHub.

Instead of just learning commands like `clone`, `pull`, and `push`, participants contributed directly to this project by submitting their feedback through Pull Requests.

## 🎯 What We Tried to Achieve

- Demonstrate real-world Git collaboration
- Practice forking and cloning repositories
- Understand branching and committing changes
- Experience the Pull Request workflow
- Observe how merges and conflicts happen
- See how multiple contributors work on the same project

Each review added to this website represents a successful contribution through a Pull Request.

## 💡 Concept Behind This Project

In real software development:

- Developers work on shared repositories
- Changes are proposed via Pull Requests
- Code is reviewed before being merged
- Multiple contributors collaborate on the same codebase

This project recreates that exact process in a simple and beginner-friendly way.

## 🚀 Outcome

By contributing to this repository, participants experienced:

- Practical Git usage
- Collaborative development workflow
- Version control in action

This repository serves as a live example of teamwork powered by Git and GitHub.
